Projects can be scaffolded using Vite with the command `npm create vite@latest`.
This command allows you to choose from multiple popular frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) and the language (JavaScript or TypeScript).

##### Execution Commands
- `npm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot reloading.
- `npm run build`: Bundles and optimizes your app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally before deployment.

# Image Previewer

Small vanilla JS project that lets you open an image using windows explorer to show the full-sized image in a preview pane.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the http-server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Scripts

- `npm lint` – Run eslint rules.
- `npm start` – Start the http-server locally.

## Things I learnt

1. We can create a file uploader using an input tag of type file.
2. FileReader class can be used to read a file and render it's contents.

# Image Previewer

Small vanilla JS project that lets you click any thumbnail to show the full-sized image in a preview pane.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open the printed URL to play with the previewer.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` – Create production build.
- `npm run preview` – Preview the production build locally.

## Things I learnt

1. We can create a file uploader using an input tag of type file.
2. FileReader class can be used to read a file and render it's contents.

# Text Previewer

Small vanilla JS project that lets you open a text file using windows explorer to show it's contents in a preview pane.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the http-server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Scripts

- `npm lint` – Run eslint rules.
- `npm start` – Start the http-server locally.

## Things I learnt

1. `readAsDataURL()` is used for rendering resources e.g.: images, videos, audio, iframe, `readAsText()` is used for rendering text content, and `readAsArrayBuffer()` is used for processing content, encryption, uploads etc.
